# Store

This project uses a command-line interface for customers and store managers to order and manage from an online store. Using node packages mysql, dotenv, and inquirer, this interface communicates with a locally hosted SQL database to conduct product inquiries, purchases, updates to stock inventory, and addition of new products.
